        <h2>Why is it difficult for small businesses to get loans from banks?</h2>
        <div class="review">
            <font size="4"><blockquote>
                Capital is difficult for automotive businesses to access for several reasons. It’s not that banks are against lending to small businesses – they want to – but traditional financial institutions have an outdated, labor-intensive lending process and regulations that are unfavorable to local shops and smaller organizations. 
            </br> </br>
                The difficulty of accessing capital is exacerbated because many small businesses applying for loans are new, and banks typically want to see at least a five-year profile of a healthy business (for instance, five years of tax data) before extending an offer. If you haven’t filed taxes or you run a cash only business, banks will not be able to help you. But Parker Financial Services can, and we work to help businesses that traditional banks can’t help.

        <div class="review">
            <font size="4"><blockquote>
                Alternative financing is any method through which business owners can acquire capital without the assistance of traditional banks. Generally, if a funding option is based entirely online, it is an alternative financing method. By this definition, options such as crowdfunding, online loan providers and cryptocurrency qualify as alternative financing.

            <font size="4"><blockquote>
                There are several reasons why small business owners might turn to business loan alternatives. Here are three of the most common.
               </br> </br>
                Lower credit requirements: Traditional banks will likely decline loans to borrowers with credit scores below a certain threshold that, often ranging between 600 and 650.
            </br> </br>
                Easy qualification: Not all small business owners meet the additional requirements to apply and be approved for traditional loans. In these cases, business loan alternatives are helpful.
            </br> </br>
                Fast approval: Traditional bank loans can take weeks to be approved, whereas some business loan alternatives give you access to funding in as little as one week.

        <h2>What are the Benefits of working with an alternative lender?</h2>
        <div class="review">
            <font size="4"><blockquote>
              
            </br></br>
                Market credibility: The startup gets to “borrow” some of the goodwill that the strategic partner has built up, and working with an established investor lends weight to the brand.
            </br></br>
                Infrastructure help: The larger partner likely has teams for marketing, IT, finance and HR – all of which are things a startup could “borrow” or utilize at a favorable rate.
            </br></br>
                Overall business guidance: It’s likely the strategic partner will join your board as part of the investment. Remember that they have a wealth of experience in business, so their advice and viewpoint will be invaluable.
            </br></br>
                Relatively hands-off partnership: A strategic partner still has their own business to run, so they are unlikely to be very involved in the day-to-day operations of the business. Occasional updates on your business, such as monthly or quarterly, are usually sufficient check-ins for them.
