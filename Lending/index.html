          Many businesses can come with steep upfront costs. You may need to buy expensive equipment and meet ongoing licensing and regulatory requirements. 
          </br></br>
          At times, cash flow can be uneven. Maybe you’re in your slow season or waiting to get an invoice paid by a customer or insurance agency. Your money may be tied up until the situation resolves.  
          </br></br>
          That’s where having easy access to business funding can ease the burden. Our lending solutions can help you manage your cash flow or invest in new equipment. 
          </br></br>
          Another way our lending can aid businesses is by helping them build their credit. Often, businesses don’t have solid business credit, though the owners might have good personal credit. Taking out a loan for the business and paying it on time each month can help your business credit scores. Later, this may help you qualify for even better financing when your business needs it.

      <center>Types of Loans Provided</center>
    </h1>
    <div class="faq-container">
      <b>1. Business Line of Credit:</b> Access to flexible, revolving funds when you need them for your shop. Borrow what you need, pay down the balance, and the funds are replenished so you can use the line again. Cover upfront inventory costs or bridge cash flow in between invoices </li>
    </br></br>
    2. Short-Term Business Loan: Terms that range from three months to three years. Total dollar cost lower than a longer-term loan. Quicker than getting a traditional loan from a bank. Pay for improvements to your shop, purchase inventory, or run marketing or advertising campaigns 
</br></br>
3. Long-Term Loan: The length of the loan can be anywhere from 2-20 years. Requires collateral to secure the loan. Attractive interest rates.  
</br></br>
4. The SBA (Small Business Administration) Loan Guarantee Program: low interest rates, steady payments, and you can generally use these loans to purchase equipment and real estate, and for working capital. 
</br></br>
5. Trade Credit: If you place regular orders from suppliers on a regular basis, you may be able to take advantage of trade credit where you have 30-90 days to pay your invoice. A popular source of short-term financing that can improve cash flow and may help build business credit. 
</br></br>
6. Merchant Cash Advance: Advanced an amount that is based on past revenues (such as debit and credit card sales), and then you pay that amount back from your daily transactions, plus any fees such as an origination fee. 
</br></br>
7. Accounts Receivable Financing: Bridges the cash flow gap so there is no disruption to a business’s everyday operations. Based on receivables which are used as collateral to secure AR loans. 
</br></br>
8. Asset Based Lending: Provides companies with financial assets a unique opportunity to borrow against these assets. All that is required is that the business has financial assets whose worth substantiates the loan’s amount. This gives businesses access to additional funds whenever they need them.  
</br></br>
9. Bridge Loans: A short-term capital injection while applicants wait to secure permanent financing solutions. 
</br></br>
10. Commercial Real Estate Loans: Will help get the funding you need to purchase your ideal commercial property. Repaid in installment payments over a predetermined period of time. 
</br></br>
11. DIP Financing: Only available to those businesses that have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Allows a business to raise funds to continue operations all-the-while going through the Chapter 11 restructuring process. 
</br></br>
12. Invoice Factoring: Helps businesses provide the necessary funds to cover emergency expenses, working capital, operating expenses, on-going bills, and other types of business expenses that they normally would have lacked the necessary funds to pay.  
</br></br>
13. Payroll Funding: Making payroll is one of the biggest responsibilities that employers face. However, if an emergency left them unable to afford their regular payroll expenses, payroll financing can help.  
</br></br>
14. Purchase order financing: Fills the financial gaps with ordering and ensures customers get their goods. Involves paying suppliers of another company for the goods needed to fulfill a job/obligation. This allows the client to receive their items without disruption.  
</br></br>
16. Working Capital Loans: Give you the opportunity to stay on top of your daily expenses and have the cash your business needs to sustain itself throughout the year.
