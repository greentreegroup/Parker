                      Capital is difficult for automotive businesses to access for several reasons. It’s not that banks are against lending to small businesses – they want to – but traditional financial institutions have an outdated, labor-intensive lending process and regulations that are unfavorable to local shops and smaller organizations.
                    </br></br>
                      The difficulty of accessing capital is exacerbated because many small businesses applying for loans are new, and banks typically want to see at least a five-year profile of a healthy business (for instance, five years of tax data) before extending an offer. If you haven’t filed taxes or you run a cash only business, banks will not be able to help you. But Parker Financial Services can, and we work to help businesses that traditional banks can’t help.

                      Alternative financing is any method through which business owners can acquire capital without the assistance of traditional banks. Generally, if a funding option is based entirely online, it is an alternative financing method. By this definition, options such as crowdfunding, online loan providers and cryptocurrency qualify as alternative financing.

                      There are several reasons why small business owners might turn to business loan alternatives. Here are three of the most common.
                    </br></br>
                      Lower credit requirements: Traditional banks will likely decline loans to borrowers with credit scores below a certain threshold that, often ranging between 600 and 650.
                    </br></br>
                      Easy qualification: Not all small business owners meet the additional requirements to apply and be approved for traditional loans. In these cases, business loan alternatives are helpful.
                    </br></br>
                      Fast approval: Traditional bank loans can take weeks to be approved, whereas some business loan alternatives give you access to funding in as little as one week.

                      Market credibility: The startup gets to “borrow” some of the goodwill that the strategic partner has built up, and working with an established investor lends weight to the brand.
                    </br></br>
                      Infrastructure help: The larger partner likely has teams for marketing, IT, finance and HR – all of which are things a startup could “borrow” or utilize at a favorable rate.
                    </br></br>
                      Overall business guidance: It’s likely the strategic partner will join your board as part of the investment. Remember that they have a wealth of experience in business, so their advice and viewpoint will be invaluable.
                    </br></br>
                      Relatively hands-off partnership: A strategic partner still has their own business to run, so they are unlikely to be very involved in the day-to-day operations of the business. Occasional updates on your business, such as monthly or quarterly, are usually sufficient check-ins for them.
