            Equipment needed to run a business can be both large in scale, and expensive. However, the equipment is necessary to perform successful work for customers. 
          </br></br>
            Equipment financing helps business owners get funding to purchase or lease equipment without depleting their working capital. Equipment loans can vary from lender to lender.
          </br></br>That’s why it’s important to partner with a financing company that can offer you the best options to fit your budget and needs.

      <center>Benefits of Equipment Financing</center>
    </h1>
    <div class="faq-container">
      <font size="4"><center>Benefits of leasing far outweigh other funding options for new equipment. </br></br> Below is a list of perks that come with leasing equipment.</center></font>
</br></br></br>
<font size="4"><ul>
  <li> With equipment loans or leases, the equipment you’re getting serves as your collateral, which means you can often get good rates on these loans.</li>
    </br></br>
    <li> Operating leases are a tax-deductible overhead expense, meaning you can deduct the lease payments from your corporate income.</li>
    </br></br>
    <li> Equipment does not have to be depreciated over five to seven years.</li>
    </br></br>
    <li> Not considered a long-term debt or liability. Makes you more attractive to traditional lenders when you need them.</li>
    </br></br>
    <li> Little downpayment. Since a lease does not require a down payment, it is equivalent to 100 percent financing.</li>
    </br></br>
    <li> As your business grows and your needs change, you can add or upgrade at any point during the lease term through add-on or master leases.</li>
    </br></br>
    <li> If the nature of your industry demands that you have the latest technology, a short-term operating lease can help you get the equipment and keep your cash.</li>
    </br></br>
    <li> Lessor assumes and manages the risk of equipment ownership. At the end of the lease, the lessor is responsible for the disposition of the asset.</li>
    </ul></font>
