Eager to explore new business opportunities, he conducted extensive research and determined that expanding his portfolio by owning an additional gas station would be a lucrative venture.
        </br></br>
          However, purchasing another gas station required a substantial amount of capital. Peter began exploring financing options to cover the acquisition cost. Initially, he approached traditional lenders, but they expressed hesitation in financing a gas station due to the perceived risks associated with the industry.

          Case Study: Expanding a Towing Company
        </h2>
      </br></br>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>

      <p></br> <font size="4">
        Dora and Lonzo came together to establish a towing company that operates in California. Within a short span of less than two years, Dora and Lonzo successfully steered their company toward remarkable growth and profitability. They had built a fleet of five trucks and employed a staff of 15 dedicated individuals. However, their rapid expansion led to a new challenge—operational capacity constraints and increasing costs. To sustain their progress and continue growing, they needed financial support.
              </br></br>
              Initially, they approached a traditional bank for a business loan, but their previous credit issues and limited business ownership experience hindered their chances of qualifying for conventional financing. After facing multiple rejections, they turned to online-only lenders who offered quick access to significant funds. Unfortunately, the exorbitant interest rates imposed by these lenders, which Dora nicknamed "loan sharks," further exacerbated their financial woes.
                    </br></br>
                    Burdened by online-only debt, Dora and Lonzo sought a way to alleviate their financial strain. Fortunately, their faith in financial institutions was reignited when they learned about Parker Financial Services, a reliable provider of business loans. With the assistance of Parker Financial Services, they were able to secure an affordable loan that proved instrumental in addressing their immediate needs.
                        </font></p>
  </div>
  <div class="d">
  </br></br></br>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>

  <p></br> <font size="4">
    The loan obtained from Parker Financial Services primarily helped their company cover outstanding bills, meet payroll obligations, perform necessary vehicle repairs, and overall stabilize the business. Lonzo expressed, "It allowed us to get the business in the right place." Moreover, being borrowers with Parker Financial Services offered more than just affordable financing; they also received valuable business guidance throughout the process. As part of the loan package, they had access to a certified accountant who helped them organize their financials, thus improving the overall health of their business.
        </br></br>
    Dora acknowledged the positive impact of their collaboration with Parker Financial Services, stating, "You helped us improve our business and get ourselves in a better situation." Empowered by their newfound financial stability, they now set their sights on expanding their operations even further. The growing demand for their services fuels their ambition, and they aspire to establish a service center and distribution center to enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, they plan to invest in acquiring more advanced and high-performing equipment, bolstering their capabilities, and enabling them to serve their clients with even greater efficiency.

      <h2>
          Case Study: Buying a Building for a Body Shop
        </h2>
      </br></br>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>

      <p></br> <font size="4">
        Business was flourishing for Jose and his auto body shop in California, but the absence of a proper parking lot was hindering his ability to keep up with the rising demand. Half of the 5,000 sq. ft shop he rented was being utilized for car storage, while the other half was dedicated to repairs. Recognizing the need to expand, Jose began searching for a larger building.
                    </br></br>
                    He came across a property for sale that offered a spacious 6,000 sq. ft workspace along with 5,000 sq. ft of parking space, equivalent to around 20 parking spots. In addition to providing ample room for his operations, the mortgage payment for this property would be only half of what he was paying in rent. The listed price for the property was $350,000, making it an appealing prospect for Jose.
                                      </br></br>
                                      Initially, Jose approached a loan officer at another SBA lender for a commercial real estate loan. However, he faced a hurdle when he discovered that the lender's minimum loan amount for commercial real estate was $650,000. Given that this would be his first business loan, Jose was hesitant about taking on such a substantial debt.
                                    </br></br>
                                    Fortunately, the loan officer at the competing loan provider set aside any rivalry and recommended Jose to their institution. Once Jose contacted his loan officer at Parker Financial Services, everything started falling into place. Within just 60 days of initiating the loan application, Jose found himself the proud owner of his new building.                     
                                    </font></p>
  </div>
  <div class="d">
  </br></br></br>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>

  <p></br> <font size="4">
    Parker Financial Services was able to provide 90% financing, taking into account Jose's strong industry experience and the fact that the loan payment would be lower than his previous rent. With the move to the new building, Jose wasted no time in hiring two additional technicians to tackle the backlog of jobs that had accumulated over the past month.
          </br></br>
          Moreover, the lower mortgage payment resulting from the loan proved to be a game-changer for Jose's business during the unforeseen arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. While three out of five competing auto body shops in the area closed due to the pandemic, Jose's business thrived with reduced competition and the ability to maintain "business as usual."
        </br></br>
        Thanks to the support and financial relief provided by Parker Financial Services, Jose's auto body shop continues to prosper. The expanded facilities, increased staff, and affordable financing have played crucial roles in driving the success of his business.
