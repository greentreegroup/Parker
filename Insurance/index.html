      <center>Types of Coverage</center>
    </h1>
    <div class="faq-container">
      1. General liability: Financial protection for some of the most common accidents at a business. For example, if someone other than an employee gets hurt or if you’re held responsible for damaging someone’s property. This insurance covers slip-and-fall injuries, property damage, Legal fees & defense costs, medical payments, reputational harm, advertising injury.  
    </br></br>
      2. Commercial property: Helps protect the physical assets you need to operate your business. After a covered event, this insurance will help with replacement or repair costs. Common items that are protected are inventory, furniture, fixtures, equipment, business income, structural damage, broken windows, and flooring. 
    </br></br>
      3. Business income insurance: Helps your company replace lost income if it’s unable to operate due to covered property damage. Some business costs that can be covered include mortgage and rent payments, employee wages and payroll, income loss during restoration period, loan payments, and tax payments.  
    </br></br>
      4. Worker Compensation: If you have employees, workers’ comp is mandatory in almost every state to help cover medical bills and lost wages if a workplace accident occurs. Add business owner’s coverage to protect yourself as well. 
    </br></br>
      5. Professional Liability/E&O: If you’re accused of making an error at work, get professional liability insurance (also known as errors & omissions insurance) and you’ll be protected from certain types of lawsuits and claims. 
    </br></br>
      6. Commercial Auto: With commercial auto, you’re covered for dents, tows and damage to someone else’s car or truck. Add Hired and Non-Owned Auto (HNOA) coverage for extra protection on rentals and employee vehicles. 
    </br></br>
      7. Tools & Equipment: Add tools and equipment upgrade to your general liability insurance. If your tools ever get damaged or stolen, we will help them get back to working order. 
    </br></br>
      8. Business Owner’s Policy: A business owner’s policy (BOP) combines general liability and commercial property into one handy package. It’s a great option for protecting your business if you have a physical location, equipment or inventory and if you deal with customers or the public. 
    </br></br>
      9. Cyber Liability Insurance: Cyber insurance can help prevent and respond to data breaches, cyber-attacks, systems failures and compromised IT. Get financial help after phishing scams and ransomware attacks, and recovery or replacement funds lost due to wire fraud.
