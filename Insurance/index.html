    <div class="faq-container"><font size="4">
      <span style="color:blue">1. General liability:</span> Financial protection for some of the most common accidents at a business. For example, if someone other than an employee gets hurt or if you’re held responsible for damaging someone’s property. This insurance covers slip-and-fall injuries, property damage, Legal fees & defense costs, medical payments, reputational harm, advertising injury.  
    </br></br>
    <span style="color:blue">2. Commercial property:</span> Helps protect the physical assets you need to operate your business. After a covered event, this insurance will help with replacement or repair costs. Common items that are protected are inventory, furniture, fixtures, equipment, business income, structural damage, broken windows, and flooring. 
    </br></br>
    <span style="color:blue">3. Business income insurance:</span> Helps your company replace lost income if it’s unable to operate due to covered property damage. Some business costs that can be covered include mortgage and rent payments, employee wages and payroll, income loss during restoration period, loan payments, and tax payments.  
    </br></br>
    <span style="color:blue">4. Worker Compensation:</span> If you have employees, workers’ comp is mandatory in almost every state to help cover medical bills and lost wages if a workplace accident occurs. Add business owner’s coverage to protect yourself as well. 
    </br></br>
    <span style="color:blue">5. Professional Liability/E&O:</span> If you’re accused of making an error at work, get professional liability insurance (also known as errors & omissions insurance) and you’ll be protected from certain types of lawsuits and claims. 
    </br></br>
